Got it! Since you’re using **VS Code on Mac** and want to create the **README file directly on GitHub**, here’s what you can do:  

1. **Go to Your GitHub Repository**  
2. Click on **"Add a README"** (you’ll see this option if the repo doesn’t have one).  
3. Copy and paste the following README content into the editor:

# 📖 RAG-Powered PDF Query System  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** using **OpenAI's API** and **ChromaDB**. It allows users to:  
✅ Upload **multiple PDF files** 📄  
✅ **Chunk** the content for efficient retrieval  
✅ **Store** the chunks in **ChromaDB**  
✅ Ask **relevant questions** about the PDFs  
✅ Get accurate responses based on the stored information  
✅ Receive a **controlled response** if the question is out of context  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **FastAPI** (for backend) ⚡  
- **ChromaDB** (for vector storage)  
- **OpenAI API** (for LLM-powered responses)  
- **PyMuPDF** / **pdfminer** (for PDF processing)  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1️⃣ PDFs are uploaded and split into **chunks**.  
2️⃣ The chunks are converted into **embeddings** and stored in **ChromaDB**.  
3️⃣ When a user asks a question, the system:  
   - Retrieves the **most relevant chunks** 📌  
   - Sends them to **OpenAI’s API** for a response ✨  
   - If the question is **out of context**, it prompts the user to ask about the uploaded PDFs only.  

## 📌 Setup Instructions  
Clone the repo and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application:  
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
