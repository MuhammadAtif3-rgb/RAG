# 🚀 RAG-Based Chatbot with OpenAI & ChromaDB  

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300?text=RAG+Chatbot+%7C+OpenAI+%7C+ChromaDB+%7C+Cardo)  

📖 **A powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that processes multiple PDFs, stores them in ChromaDB, and provides accurate responses using OpenAI's API. It ensures relevant answers and ignores out-of-context queries. Includes a sleek frontend built with Cardo!**  

---

## 🔥 Features  
✅ **PDF Processing** – Extracts and chunks text from multiple PDFs.  
✅ **ChromaDB Storage** – Efficient vector storage for quick retrieval.  
✅ **OpenAI-Powered Responses** – Generates answers based on provided data.  
✅ **Out-of-Context Filtering** – Ignores unrelated questions.  
✅ **Modern UI with Cardo** – Seamless user experience with an interactive frontend.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file and add your **OpenAI API key**:  
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project  

### 🏗️ **Step 1: Ingest PDFs & Initialize Database**  
This step processes the PDFs, chunks the text, and stores it in **ChromaDB**.  
```bash
python ingest_database.py
```

### 🤖 **Step 2: Start the Chatbot**  
Run the chatbot server to handle user queries.  
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### 🎨 **Step 3: Run the Frontend (Cardo UI)**  
If using a frontend, ensure Cardo is properly set up and running.

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Upload PDFs** – The system processes and chunks the text.  
2️⃣ **Store in ChromaDB** – Efficient retrieval for quick responses.  
3️⃣ **User Queries** – Ask relevant questions and get precise answers.  
4️⃣ **Out-of-Context Detection** – Blocks unrelated queries.

## 🏆 Why Use This?  
✅ **Accurate & Fast** – Retrieves only relevant data.  
✅ **Secure & Scalable** – Uses ChromaDB for optimized performance.  
✅ **Easy to Use** – Simple setup and smooth UI with Cardo.
